# Universe Bot

Universe Bot is a chat bot built on the [Hubot][hubot] framework. It was initially generated by [generator-hubot][generator-hubot], and configured to be deployed on [Glitch][glitch] to get you up and running as quickly as possible. Glitch will deploy your hubot and keep it running as long as your web browser has it open. If you want to deploy to something more persistent, see the directions in the Choose Your Own Adventure section below to deploy to Heroku.

This README is intended to help get you started. Definitely update and improve
to talk about your own instance, how to use and deploy, what functionality is
available, etc!

## Part 1: Steps for Getting Started
1. Fork the [githubteacher/universe-bot repository](https://github.com/githubteacher/universe-bot)
2. In [Glitch](https://glitch.com), import your fork of the githubteacher/universe-bot repository
  - Click 'Edit Code'
  - Click the title of the app on the top left
  - Select 'Advanced Options'
  - By 'Import from GitHub', click 'Grant Access' and allow the app the proper permissions
  - Select 'Import from GitHub' and type the name of your fork, `USERNAME/universe-bot`
  - **Note: Any changes made in Glitch will not automatically be made in your fork. The steps are similar to importing, but instead select 'Export to GitHub'.**
3. In Glitch, replace the contents of the `.env` file with:
  ```
  HUBOT_SLACK_TOKEN=xoxb-215455607634-fipghNUy3cAnBnvYqRw5cRuF

This link will ask for an email address and send you instructions for joining our team. Once you've joined, you can test this by saying something that the bot is already looking for, like "satellite".
